# NanoclusterModeler

This Julia package provides a complicated system of coupled ordinary differential equations to model nanocluster formation. The model is described in the following paper: https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.11865879.v1.

The src directory contains the NanoclusterModeler.jl module. The module contains five functions needed to use the model. The examples directory contains example.jl which illustrates the use of the module. Also provided in the example directory is a python script to produce a movie from the data.
